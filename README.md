# Project4_jack_santini
Project4_jack_santini is a practice in exporting a Version Controlled version of a completed STAT540 Project, in this case Project1.
Project1 explores creating plots, cleaning/sorting data, and basic dataframe manipulation/interpretation using a dataset on infant health and development.

Pending a final decision on which project to upload (Project1, Project2, or Project3), the data folder has the data relevant for each of the projects.
